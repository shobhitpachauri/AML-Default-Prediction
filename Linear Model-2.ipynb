Data Processing\n","\n","### Main data processing steps for linear models:\n","1. **One-Hot Ecoding**: i.e. converting categorical observations to numerical. For this model, we just removed categorical features, and will discuss this step in the next sessions.\n","2. **Outlier Treatment**: We can detect outliers by looking at summary statistics, and comparing P99 with Max and P1 with Min. A large difference indicates an outlier. Another way to detect outliers is by looking at the distribution (histogram) of the feature, and detect outliers optically. To treat outliers, one approach is to use P1 and P99 as floor and cap, respectively. i.e. replace any value less than P1 by P1 and replace any value higher than P99 by P99.\n","\n","Here, I leave it on you to calculate P1 and P99 percentiles (in assignment 1), and in assignment 2 ask you to:\n","\n","*Assignment 2: Cap (and floor) both features, to their 99th (and 1st) percentiles.*\n","3. **Feature Scaling**: Ideally we like all **Independent Variables** to have similar scales. If not, linear model will focus on features with larger scales, and will generate non-optimal results, because information in features with lower scale, will be lost.\n","\n","Here, our (independent) features, \"Age\" and \"Years of Experience\" have close scales, so no feature scaling needed. We will discuss popular feature scaling techniques, in Neural Netwok session.\n","4. **Missing Value Imputation**: Missing values are missing information. Like about someone's Age. Machine expects **ONLY** numbers.\n","If missing happens in the target (dependent) variable, we often remove those observations. Unless limited data is available.\n","\n","If missing value happens in independent variables, some popular approaches are as following:\n","*   Replace missing values of the feature, with average of non-missing observations\n","*   Replace missing values of the feature, with median of non-missing observations\n","*   With 0\n","*   With a very large or small number, like: 999,999 or -999,999. In order to distinguish these observations from non-missing values. These way, we can penalize lack of information. More on this, Neural Network session.\n","\n","Summary statistics shows there is no missing in \"Age\", but there is one in \"Years of Experience\". It may have already be deleted (when we deleted missing Salary), but we will check. If not deleted, we will replace it with 0.\n","\n","Some Machine Learning packages, handle missing values automatically, so you don't have to worry about how to impute missing values. More on this in Ensemble Models session.\n","\n","\n","We may also decide to delete all observations with any missing (in dependent, or independent variables), but often we would end up with too many exclusions, and we don't have unlimited data.\n","\n","\n","**Data Quantity** and **Computational Power** define limts in a Data Science project, *limits of our dreams regarding what machine can do*. Find a way to expand the **Optimization Boundary** in a field, beyond others can do, and you are on the path to have your own company, a data-driven start-up.\n","\n","In this calss, we will discuss rules of boundary.\n","\n","5. **No Multi-Collinearity**: Last step in data processing for a inear model is to check for Multi-Collinearity. Multi-Collinearity means some features are highly correlated. That makes the model non-robust; i.e. model would chang siginificantly sample from sample (different samples from the population).\n","\n","In case of Multi-Collinearity, we keep only one feature among the ones with high correlation. What is high correlation? 70%, 80%, 90%, 99%??? It is a judgmental call, like many other steps in a ML project.
