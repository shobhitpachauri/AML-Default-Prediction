üí≥ AML Default Prediction
üìñ Problem Statement

Predicting loan defaults is critical in the financial industry to mitigate risks and prevent significant losses. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to default on their loans, enabling proactive measures to reduce financial risks and improve decision-making.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

    Programming Language: Python üêç
    Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook üìì
    Libraries:
        Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
        Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
        Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost
        Model Evaluation: Metrics like ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall

üîç Approach

    Data Collection and Cleaning:
        Import loan datasets and preprocess the data.
        Handle missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization.

    Feature Engineering:
        Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key features.
        Create new features based on domain knowledge to improve model performance.

    Model Selection and Training:
        Experiment with multiple machine learning models, such as:
            Logistic Regression
            Random Forest
            Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
        Fine-tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

    Evaluation:
        Use evaluation metrics like ROC-AUC, F1-score, and Precision-Recall curves.
        Compare model performances and select the best-performing model.

    Deployment (Optional):
        Package the model for production use with APIs or web apps.

üéØ Outcome/Results

The project successfully builds a robust predictive model for loan default prediction. The final model achieves high performance with a ROC-AUC score of XX.XX% (replace with actual results). This helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions and minimize risks.
